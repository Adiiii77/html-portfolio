<h3>The Departed</h3>
<p>Martin Scorsese's best movie. Really love the acting and dialogue and all the twists and turns and its background score and music.</p>
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>Who doesn't love this movie. Has all the things you would expect from a bollywood movie.</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>Really awesome movie. Wish I could experience it for the first time again. Tyler Durdy :).</p>
